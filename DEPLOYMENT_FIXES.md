# Deployment Fixes for Vercel

This document outlines the issues that were preventing deployment on Vercel and the fixes that were applied.

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Package.json Syntax Error ✅
**Issue**: Missing comma after the `quill` dependency (line 53), causing JSON parsing error.
**Fix**: Added the missing comma.

### 2. Duplicate Next.js Configuration Files ✅
**Issue**: Both `next.config.ts` and `next.config.mjs` existed in the project, causing configuration conflicts.
**Fix**: Removed `next.config.ts` and kept only `next.config.mjs`.

### 3. React Version Incompatibility ✅
**Issue**: React 18.2.0 was specified, but Next.js 15 requires React 19.
**Fix**: Updated both `react` and `react-dom` to version `^19.2.0`.

### 4. Turbopack Flag in Build Script ✅
**Issue**: The `--turbopack` flag was used in both `dev` and `build` scripts, which is experimental and was causing webpack configuration conflicts.
**Fix**: Removed the `--turbopack` flag from both scripts.

### 5. Deprecated serverActions Configuration ✅
**Issue**: The `experimental.serverActions` configuration in `next.config.mjs` is deprecated in Next.js 15.
**Fix**: Removed the deprecated experimental configuration.

### 6. API Route Parameters Not Awaited ✅
**Issue**: In Next.js 15, dynamic route parameters are now promises and must be awaited. All dynamic API routes had the old syntax:
```typescript
{ params }: { params: { id: string } }
```

**Fix**: Updated all dynamic API routes to use the new async params syntax:
```typescript
{ params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }
```
And added `const { id } = await params;` at the start of each handler.

**Files Updated**:
- `app/api/contact/[id]/route.ts`
- `app/api/education/[id]/route.ts`
- `app/api/experiences/[id]/route.ts`
- `app/api/projects/[id]/route.ts`
- `app/api/skills/[id]/route.ts`
- `app/api/blog-admin/[id]/route.ts` (already fixed)

## Deployment Readiness

The following changes make the project ready for deployment on Vercel:

1. ✅ All syntax errors fixed
2. ✅ Configuration conflicts resolved
3. ✅ Dependencies updated to compatible versions
4. ✅ API routes updated to Next.js 15 standards
5. ✅ Deprecated configurations removed

## Next Steps

1. Push these changes to your repository
2. Connect the repository to Vercel (if not already connected)
3. Add required environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
   - `MONGODB_URI` - Your MongoDB connection string
   - Any other environment variables required by your application (check `.env.example` if it exists)
4. Deploy!

## Notes

- The build may take a few minutes on first deployment as Vercel installs dependencies and builds the Next.js application.
- Make sure your MongoDB database is accessible from Vercel's deployment servers.
- The fonts will load correctly on Vercel as they have internet access to Google Fonts.
