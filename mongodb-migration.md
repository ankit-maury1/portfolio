# MongoDB Migration Summary

This document summarizes the work done to migrate the portfolio application from SQLite to MongoDB.

## Completed Tasks

1. **MongoDB Connection Setup**
   - Created `lib/mongodb.ts` for MongoDB connection pooling
   - Created `lib/mongodb-helpers.ts` with generic CRUD helper functions
   - Added TypeScript types in `types/mongodb.ts`

2. **API Routes Updated**
   - Blog Posts API routes (`/api/blog-posts` and `/api/blog-posts/[id]`)
   - Blog Tags API routes (`/api/blog-tags` and `/api/blog-tags/[id]`)
   - Experiences API routes (`/api/experiences` and `/api/experiences/[id]`)
   - Education API routes (`/api/education` and `/api/education/[id]`)
   - Projects API routes (`/api/projects` and `/api/projects/[id]`)
   - Skills API routes (`/api/skills` and `/api/skills/[id]`)
   - Skill Categories API routes (`/api/skill-categories`)

3. **Authentication**
   - Installed `@auth/mongodb-adapter` for MongoDB integration with NextAuth
   - Updated `auth.ts` and NextAuth configuration to use MongoDB

4. **Data Seeding**
   - Created `scripts/seed-mongodb.js` for seeding initial data
   - Created `seed-mongodb.ps1` script to run the seeder
   - Added test connection script `scripts/test-mongodb-connection.js`

## MongoDB Data Model Changes

1. **ObjectId**
   - Using MongoDB ObjectId for primary keys
   - Converting ObjectIds to strings in API responses (using the id property)
   - Removed _id from responses to prevent duplicates

2. **Relations**
   - Projects to Skills: Many-to-many using arrays of ObjectIds
   - Blog Posts to Tags: Many-to-many using arrays of ObjectIds
   - Skills to Categories: One-to-many using categoryId reference

3. **Data Enrichment**
   - Used MongoDB aggregation pipelines for data joins (lookup)
   - Implemented better relationship handling in many-to-many relationships

4. **UI Integration**
   - Verified navbar and page navigation work with MongoDB data
   - Ensured admin panel can access and modify data

## MongoDB Benefits

1. **Flexibility**
   - Easier to work with nested and related data
   - Schema-less design allows for evolving data structures

2. **Scalability**
   - MongoDB Atlas provides cloud-based scaling
   - Better performance for read-heavy operations

3. **Development Experience**
   - More natural data modeling for JavaScript/TypeScript
   - Better support for arrays and nested documents

## Additional Notes

- The application now uses MongoDB Atlas cloud database
- MongoDB connection string is provided in the `.env` file as `MONGODB_URI`
- Added instructions in the README.md for database setup
- Type definitions for MongoDB models can be found in `types/mongodb.ts`
